# AI Session — Next Steps and Reference

Purpose
- Single authoritative reference for the next AI session: what failed, what was changed, where to look, and prioritized tasks to finish the "locations" feature and related reliability issues.

Context snapshot
- Project: IBAPOS (Laravel 10+, PHP 8.2, XAMPP local dev on Windows)
- Recent work: reusable confirmation modal, AJAX delete, LocationController destroy hardened to prevent delete when dependencies exist, DeveloperPermissionMiddleware previously caused PHP fatal due to signature mismatch (may be left intentionally as a guard).
- Current known runtime behaviour: DELETE reaches server but may return 500 if fatal error occurs (developer-mode middleware can cause fatal). Controller now blocks delete when dependent records exist and returns JSON 422 with details.

Top priorities (ordered)
1. Capture server-side 500 stack trace during Delete (live tail Laravel logs and Apache/PHP logs). If fatal is from middleware, fix or preserve as feature (developer-mode guard). See "Reproduce".
2. Ensure AJAX Delete UX: when controller returns 422 (blocking), show message inside the confirmation modal (not only toast). Implement frontend handling for 4xx with detailed messages.
3. Add automated tests:
   - Feature test to assert LocationController returns 422 when dependencies exist.
   - AJAX feature test that asserts JSON message appears and no row removed.
   - (Optional) E2E test (Playwright/Dusk) for modal / optimistic removal flow.
4. Decide and implement data strategy for deletions:
   - Soft deletes on Location model OR
   - Reassignment flow / admin UI to reassign dependent records OR
   - DB-level ON DELETE SET NULL / CASCADE (risky); document and backup.
5. Clean up UI flash duplication and ensure consistent toast behavior (done for locations index; propagate pattern elsewhere if desired).
6. Harden migrations / idempotency for tests (already partially done). Run full test suite and fix failures.

Reproduction & debug commands (PowerShell, run from project root)
- Tail Laravel log (capture fresh 500 immediately after reproducing):
  Get-Content "${PWD}\storage\logs\laravel.log" -Tail 200 -Wait

- Tail Apache & PHP logs (XAMPP):
  Get-Content 'C:\xampp\apache\logs\error.log' -Tail 200 -Wait
  Get-Content 'C:\xampp\php\logs\php_error_log' -Tail 200 -Wait  # may not exist; check php.ini

- Run PHPUnit (quick):
  vendor\bin\phpunit --filter Location --testdox
  # or using artisan test
  php artisan test --testsuite=Feature

- Quick DB dependency counts for location id=ID (via tinker):
  php artisan tinker
  # in tinker:
  $id = ID;
  $tables = ['stocks','sale_items','sales','purchases','stock_mutations','adjustments','reservations'];
  foreach ($tables as $t) { try { echo $t.': '.\DB::table($t)->where('location_id',$id)->count().PHP_EOL; } catch (\Throwable $e) { echo $t.': (no col)'.PHP_EOL; } }

Files to inspect first (high-value)
- `app/Http/Controllers/LocationController.php` — destroy logic, JSON messages
- `resources/views/components/confirmation-modal.blade.php` — modal open / submit interception and UI removal
- `resources/views/locations/*` — includes and toast usage
- `app/Http/Middleware/DeveloperPermissionMiddleware.php` — signature / behaviour (was causing fatal error)
- `storage/logs/laravel.log` and XAMPP apache/php logs
- `app/Services/InventoryService.php`, `app/Services/AdjustmentService.php` — references to location_id
- `database/migrations` — check FK constraints and idempotency

Frontend tasks (small)
- Show blocking 422 message inside modal: when fetch returns 422 with JSON { message, details }, display it in modal (inline). Don9t close modal on 4xx.
- Ensure confirm button disabled/feedback while request in-progress (already exists) and re-enable on error.
- For successful delete, keep optimistic removal; if server later fails, consider reloading or showing undo.

Server tasks (small/medium)
- If middleware fatal persists, decide: revert to fixed signature or keep as guard and log less verbosely.
- Add a migration or model change for soft deletes if chosen.
- Add DB constraints or migration to safely set null or cascade (after design decision).

Tests to add
- `tests/Feature/LocationDestroyDependencyTest.php`: create records in dependent tables, attempt delete, assert 422 and DB unchanged.
- `tests/Feature/AjaxDeleteLocationTest.php`: simulate AJAX DELETE, assert JSON message and that table row still exists.
- Add test to ensure confirmation modal doesn't remove DOM element when 4xx returned (JS test via Dusk/Playwright if available).

Notes for next AI session (what to say to resume quickly)
- "Resume from: AI-SESSION-NEXT-STEPS.md" (this file)
- Key facts to mention: which location id you tried to delete; whether developer_mode is enabled; output of `Get-Content storage/logs/laravel.log -Tail 200` captured right after reproducing the delete.

Risk & rollbacks
- Changing FKs to cascade risks losing historical data. Prefer soft-delete or UI reassignment.
- Automated mass deletes should be disabled in production without manual review.

Quick checklist (copyable)
- [ ] Reproduce delete -> capture laravel.log (tail -Wait) and Apache error log
- [ ] Implement modal inline error display for 422
- [ ] Write Feature tests for dependency-blocking
- [ ] Decide soft-delete vs cascade vs reassign
- [ ] Add E2E test for modal flow
- [ ] Run full test suite and fix failures

Contact points in repo
- Modal view: `resources/views/components/confirmation-modal.blade.php`
- Location controller: `app/Http/Controllers/LocationController.php`
- Middleware: `app/Http/Middleware/DeveloperPermissionMiddleware.php`
- Inventory logic: `app/Services/InventoryService.php`
