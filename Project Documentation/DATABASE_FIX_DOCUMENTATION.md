# Database Migration Fix - deleted_at Column Error

## 🚨 Problem
After migration rollback, error occurred:
```
SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'users.deleted_at' in 'where clause'
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
- Model `User` uses `SoftDeletes` trait expecting `deleted_at` column
- Migration `add_deleted_at_to_users_table` was in "Pending" status after rollback
- Application tried to query with `deleted_at` column that didn't exist

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Check Migration Status
```bash
php artisan migrate:status
```
Found: `2025_09_10_000001_add_deleted_at_to_users_table` was **Pending**

### 2. Run Pending Migration
```bash
php artisan migrate
```
Result: 
- ✅ `add_deleted_at_to_users_table` successfully migrated
- ❌ `create_kasbons_table` failed (table already exists)

### 3. Remove Duplicate Migration
```bash
Remove-Item "database\migrations\2025_09_11_000000_create_kasbons_table.php" -Force
```

### 4. Verification
- ✅ POS system accessible: `http://localhost/Data%20IBA%20POS/IBAPOS/public/pos`
- ✅ Login page working: `http://localhost/Data%20IBA%20POS/IBAPOS/public/login`
- ✅ Test pages working: `http://localhost/Data%20IBA%20POS/IBAPOS/public/test-location-receipt.html`

## 📊 Final Migration Status
```
✅ 2025_09_10_000001_add_deleted_at_to_users_table - [6] Ran
✅ 2025_09_14_061728_add_phone_to_locations_table - [5] Ran
❌ 2025_09_11_000000_create_kasbons_table - REMOVED (duplicate)
```

## 🎯 Key Learning
When using `SoftDeletes` trait in Eloquent models:
1. Ensure `deleted_at` column exists in database
2. Check migration status before rollback operations
3. Always run pending migrations that add required columns

## ✅ Status: **RESOLVED**
- Database schema consistent
- Application running without errors
- Location-based receipt system fully functional
- All migrations properly executed
