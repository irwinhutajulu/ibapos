Session: 17 — September 18, 2025

Summary
-------
This session focused on finalizing the stock adjustments and dashboard work, migrating draft sales to posted with ledger integrity, and fixing UI/controller issues discovered during verification. The main goals were:

- Ensure the adjustments form shows Location and Product dropdowns.
- Fix the SQL/controller errors causing 500s on the create adjustment page.
- Continue verification of the prior migration scripts and UI updates.

Actions taken
-------------
1. Controller fixes
   - `app/Http/Controllers/StockAdjustmentsController.php`
     - Added loading of `$locations = Location::orderBy('name')->get(['id','name']);` in `create()` and `edit()` and passed them to the views.
     - Added loading of `$products = Product::orderBy('name')->get(['id','name']);` in `create()` and `edit()` and passed them to the views.
     - Removed the non-existent `code` column from the products select to avoid SQL errors.
   - Reason: `resources/views/adjustments/partials/_form.blade.php` maps `collect($locations ?? [])` and `collect($products ?? [])` to `<x-select>` options. Without `$locations`/`$products` provided, selects showed no options. Fetching `code` caused an SQL error because the column didn't exist.

2. Blade view
   - `resources/views/adjustments/partials/_form.blade.php`
     - Verified the Location select is wired as:
       <x-select name="location_id" :options="collect($locations ?? [])->map(fn($l) => ['value' => data_get($l,'id'), 'label' => data_get($l,'name')])->toArray()" ... />
     - Product select similarly maps `$products` into options.
     - The dynamic JS row insertion currently uses a plain `<select>` generated by a server-side `@foreach` which is kept as-is for now. Possible improvement: use the same `<x-select>` markup for dynamic rows for consistent searchable/selectable behavior.

3. Log inspection and fixes
   - Inspected `storage/logs/laravel.log` to identify the 500 error from the create page.
   - Found SQL error: "Unknown column 'code' in 'field list'" originating from selecting `code` from `products`.
   - Patched the controller to remove `code` from the select list. Cleared compiled views and linted the controller.

4. Scripts and Inventory Service fixes (earlier session items — summarized)
   - Scripts to generate top-up CSVs and apply stock adjustments were created and iterated on.
   - Fixed InventoryService call site issues: ensure `refId` is int, cast qty and unit_cost appropriately, validate user id.
   - Applied top-ups for location 12 (CSV applied) and converted draft sales to posted at location 12 (2806 sales). Backups were taken before live writes.

Verification performed
---------------------
- Ran `php artisan view:clear` and `php -l` on the modified controller; no syntax errors.
- Confirmed the routes for `stock-adjustments.create` exist via `php artisan route:list --name=stock-adjustments`.
- Reload the create page in the browser (recommended) to verify the selects render; logs indicate the previous 500 should now be resolved.

Notes and caveats
-----------------
- The dynamic JS insertion for new item rows uses a server-side `@foreach` inside a JS template string and outputs plain `<select>` markup; this is functional but inconsistent with the `<x-select>` component used for initial rows.
- If you want searchable/selectable behavior on dynamically added rows, we should replace the JS row template with Alpine-driven markup that initializes the same select component, or re-render the select via an AJAX fragment.
- Consider adding a view composer to inject `$locations` and `$products` into adjustment-related views to avoid repeating controller code.

Next steps
----------
- Manually verify the create page shows Location and Product options. If any errors remain, paste the latest `storage/logs/laravel.log` snippet and I'll debug further.
- Optionally implement a view composer in `App\Providers\AppServiceProvider` or a dedicated `ViewServiceProvider` to inject `$locations`/`$products` globally.
- (Optional) Update the JS dynamic row code to use the same `<x-select>` UI for consistency.

Files changed
-------------
- app/Http/Controllers/StockAdjustmentsController.php — load and pass `locations` and `products`; removed `code` from products select.
- Project Documentation/17-SESSION-SEPTEMBER-18-2025-COMPLETION.md — this file (session notes).

Status
------
- Controller/view fixes: Done
- Verification: In-progress — please reload the UI and confirm
- Documentation: Done
