Project handoff — snapshot for next AI / developer
===============================================

Purpose
-------
This file consolidates the recent work, critical files, commands, and next steps so the next AI session or developer can continue immediately.

Context
-------
- Project root: C:\xampp\htdocs\IBAPOS
- OS / shell used: Windows / PowerShell
- Recent work focused on: Users admin UI, soft deletes for `User`, delete/restore UX, relation visibility for trashed users, and tests.

Quick status
------------
- Users now soft-delete instead of hard-delete (Eloquent SoftDeletes).
- Related models that reference `User` have been updated to return trashed users via `->withTrashed()`.
- Admin users index has a "Show trashed" toggle and a Restore button. Restore endpoint added.
- Delete modal JavaScript fixed and wired to send JSON-aware DELETE requests; controller returns JSON for AJAX.
- Feature tests added for soft-delete coverage and relations. Several minimal factories were added to support tests.

Files changed / added (high-level)
--------------------------------
- app/Models/User.php
  - SoftDeletes trait enabled
- app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php
  - index(): accepts `show_trashed` query param and appends it to pagination
  - restore(Request $request, $id): restores soft-deleted users (returns JSON for AJAX)
  - destroy(): returns JSON for AJAX and handles FK exceptions
- routes/web.php
  - Added: POST /admin/users/{id}/restore (name: admin.users.restore)
- resources/views/users/index.blade.php
  - Added "Show trashed" checkbox and restore button
  - Replaced icon-only actions with inline-flex labeled buttons (Edit / Delete / Restore) matching Sales UI
  - JS handlers: show_trashed toggle and AJAX restore (uses CSRF token)
- resources/views/components/confirmation-modal.blade.php
  - (Earlier edits) fixed regex for trimming slashes and wired action construction reliably
- database/migrations/*
  - migration added to add `deleted_at` to `users` table (softDeletes)
- tests/Feature/
  - UserSoftDeleteTest.php (previously added)
  - RelationsSoftDeletedUserTest.php (new) — asserts many relations still return trashed user
- database/factories/
  - Added factories: PurchaseFactory, ExpenseCategoryFactory, ExpenseFactory, DeliveryFactory, KasbonFactory (to support tests)

Important code/behavior notes
-----------------------------
- UI: `users.index` adds `?show_trashed=1` to the pagination when toggled.
- Restore endpoint: POST /admin/users/{id}/restore (protected by same permission middleware as other admin user routes).
- Confirmation modal helper: global helper `openConfirmationModal` used in multiple places; delete/restore buttons rely on it or use fetch.
- Relations updated to include trashed users: Sale, Purchase, Expense, Delivery (assignedUser), Kasbon (requester & approver), NotificationSetting (user), Location (users belongsToMany), etc.

How to reproduce/verify locally (PowerShell)
-------------------------------------------
Open PowerShell (project root C:\xampp\htdocs\IBAPOS) and run:

php -v
composer --version

# Composer/autoload + clear caches (already used during edits)
composer dump-autoload
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear

# Run migrations (if needed)
php artisan migrate

# Run tests (focus on new tests)
php artisan test --filter RelationsSoftDeletedUserTest
php artisan test --filter UserSoftDeleteTest

# Collect diagnostics script (already in repo)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\collect-diagnostics.ps1

# Tail logs (PowerShell)
Get-Content .\storage\logs\laravel.log -Tail 50
Get-Content 'C:\xampp\apache\logs\error.log' -Tail 50

Key commands used during work
----------------------------
- composer dump-autoload; php artisan config:clear; php artisan cache:clear
- php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
- php artisan test --filter RelationsSoftDeletedUserTest

Notes about tests
-----------------
- Tests added to ensure soft-delete doesn't break relations. They rely on minimal model factories that were created under `database/factories/`.
- If tests fail due to missing factories, make sure `composer dump-autoload` was run and that the test database is configured in `phpunit.xml` / `.env.testing`.

Pending / recommended next steps
--------------------------------
1. UI polish: make restore action use the same confirmation modal pattern used by Products (currently restore reloads page after fetch). Optionally change to DOM-only update.
2. Add test for the restore endpoint (Feature test to POST to restore and assert user is untrashed).
3. Add visual badge / styling across the app where soft-deleted users appear so end users notice "(Archived)" consistently.
4. Consider global policies for showing trashed users vs hiding them depending on the feature (a global scope or config flag).
5. Expand tests to include Sale->user relation and other relations as needed.

Where to look first
-------------------
- `app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php` — index/restore/destroy logic
- `resources/views/users/index.blade.php` — UI toggle, restore/delete buttons, JS handlers
- `tests/Feature/RelationsSoftDeletedUserTest.php` — tests validating relations
- `database/migrations/` — find the migration that adds `deleted_at` to `users`

If you need me to continue in the same session
---------------------------------------------
- I can add a Feature test for the restore endpoint.
- I can change restore flow to use the existing confirmation modal pattern and update the DOM only (no reload).
- I can add UI indicators in other templates where users are shown (sales, purchases, kasbon views).

End of handoff
